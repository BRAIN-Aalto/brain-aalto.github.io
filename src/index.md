# Welcome to the BRAIN Lab webpage!

Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the promise of revolutionizing many sectors of the economy. However, its lack of robustness is slowing down adoption in many critical applications.  In the domain of vision notably, studies comparing the robustness of human vision with AI consistently show the superior and exquisite robustness of human vision. A notable source of confusion for AI systems are symmetric transformations: for example, visual objects seen from a rare perspective, corresponding to a rotational transformation from the upright pose, are often not correctly recognized by AI. 

In this lab, the *Bidirectional Research in AI and Neuroscience* lab (BRAIN), we set ourselves to understand how both humans and artificial systems treat symmetric transformations present in visual scenes, with a particular attention to cases where humans are more robust than AI. Our ultimate objective is the design of AI systems which, inspired by the visual system, offer the same guarantees of robustness. For this, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach comprising (a) experiments in neuroscience and cognitive science, (b) the development of mathematical theories of deep and recurrent networks for symmetry learning, (c) the development of computational models of the visual system, and ultimately of bio-inspired systems for artificial vision. 

Our project finds its place in a uniquely suitable context where we have concomitantly: an unparalled experimental access to the brain and to large-scale open datasets of brain recordings; a good understanding of the limitations of modern deep learning approaches; an access to massive computational resources combined with modern software libraries to train neural networks; the consolidation of nascent mathematical theories of deep learning and recurrent computations in the brain.
