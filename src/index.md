# Welcome to the BRAIN Lab webpage!

In the *Bidirectional Research in AI and Neuroscience* lab (BRAIN), we seek to understand how both humans and artificial systems treat visual scenes, with a particular attention to cases where humans are more robust than AI. For this, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach comprising (a) experiments in neuroscience and cognitive science, (b) the development of mathematical theories of deep and recurrent networks, (c) the development of computational models of the visual system, and ultimately of bio-inspired systems for artificial vision. 

Our work is carried out at a time where we have:  
- an unparalled experimental access to the brain and to large-scale open datasets of brain recordings;  
- a good understanding of the limitations of modern deep learning approaches;  
- an access to massive computational resources combined with modern software libraries to train neural networks;  
- the consolidation of nascent mathematical theories of deep learning and recurrent computations in the brain.
